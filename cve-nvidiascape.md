# CVE-2025-23266 (NVIDIAScape) Lab

In this respective lab, I will attempt to recreate CVE-2025-23266 (NVIDIASCAPE) for the purposes of a deeper study and understanding of the container escape bug in NVIDIA's AI container.

This lab represents my attempt to continue to deepen my study of Blue Team strategies and tools that will prepare me to identify, understand, and detect such a threat — as well as explore topics that I am still continuing to learn and work through as I continue my learning journey through a lifetime of Blue Team mastery.

My focus here is to also explore some vulnerabilities.  
(I know there are more out there, but it is here I chose to start my understanding — in addition to all the certification and book study.)

I will provide you screenshots of the VM setup, as well as the tools used to mimic the respective attack. In some areas, I may have to use comparative software where the specifics may not be able to be replicated.

Furthermore, I will also share my thoughts, trials, and tribulations — and frustrations — as I reflect on the setup, discoveries, and research of the respective subject matter. I will document my tools, setup, etc.



## Use of AI in This Lab

In the spirit of transparency:  
AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) were used to better understand various topics — but only in the **setup areas** that I may have had trouble understanding.

Specifically, this applied to:
- Definitions and terminology I wasn’t familiar with
- Breaking down complex explanations in simpler terms

For context: I’m finishing up an associate degree, transitioning into my bachelor’s, and working through multiple cert certification studies. So there were a good number of terms that were unfamiliar — even if I understood the idea behind them.

The majority of the work was completed using good old-fashioned Google and community research.  
When the text got too confusing, I would copy the entire thread into ChatGPT and ask it to make it plain or summarize so I could add it to my notes.



## Screenshot Reminders (Add Later)

- Your VM environment setup (Ubuntu/Docker)
- Terminal with NVIDIA container toolkit showing installed version
- A `docker run` command that mimics the breakout
- Your tools (Falco, auditd, syslog)
- Notes where you used AI help to clarify a setup issue
